## Notes

**Clarifications Resolved (3 total)**:

1. **FR-032 - Parent Authentication Method**: ✅ Hybrid approach
   - Decision: WhatsApp/Telegram verified account OR code parent (from Baserow) for numbers not in database
   - Rationale: Balances security with accessibility for new parents

2. **FR-056 - Mobile Money Operators**: ✅ Keep current operators only
   - Decision: Orange Money, Wave, Free Money (no MTN or Moov for MVP)
   - Rationale: Focus on currently used operators, reduce integration complexity

3. **FR-058 - Payment Verification**: ✅ Hybrid OCR + manual validation
   - Decision: OCR extracts payment info from screenshot, treasurer validates manually with pre-filled data
   - Rationale: Balances automation benefits with validation accuracy

**Status**: ✅ All clarifications resolved. Specification complete and ready for planning phase.
