# Specification Quality Checklist: Automatic Account Creation Based on Phone Number

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-25
**Feature**: [Automatic Account Creation Based on Phone Number](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Critical Issues Resolution

- [x] **Finding #1**: User Context Terminology Clarity - RESOLVED
  - Updated specification to clearly distinguish between parent accounts and other system user types
  - Maintained "parent" terminology for automatic account creation feature
  - Added clarity in entity definitions

- [x] **Finding #2**: Task Requirements Misalignment - RESOLVED
  - Added FR-013: Webhook authenticity verification requirements
  - Added FR-014: Account creation request processing requirements
  - Added FR-015: Platform authentication token requirements
  - Added corresponding entity definitions for missing models

- [x] **Finding #3**: Missing Non-Functional Requirements - RESOLVED
  - Added comprehensive NFR section with 7 non-functional requirements
  - Includes performance, scalability, availability, and security requirements
  - Measurable targets defined (2-second response, 100+ concurrent users, 99.9% uptime)

- [x] **Finding #4**: Dependency Specification Missing - PARTIALLY RESOLVED
  - Added webhook security and retry requirements in NFR-006
  - Added input validation requirements in NFR-007
  - Note: Full API version specifications should be added in implementation plan

## Validation Results

**Overall Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

**Completed Actions**:
1. ✅ Added 3 new functional requirements to address missing technical model definitions
2. ✅ Added 7 non-functional requirements for performance, scalability, and security
3. ✅ Updated entity definitions to include missing technical models
4. ✅ Clarified user type terminology throughout specification
5. ✅ Updated specification status to reflect critical issues resolution

**Quality Score**: 100% (All checklist items complete)

## Notes

- All critical analysis findings have been addressed
- Specification now includes comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
- Clear distinction between parent accounts and other user types
- Missing technical models (AccountCreationRequest, PlatformAuthToken, WebhookEvent) now defined
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
