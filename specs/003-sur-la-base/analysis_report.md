## Detailed Findings

### 🔴 Critical Issues

#### 1. User Context Terminology Clarity
**File**: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
**Section**: User Stories, Technical Architecture
**Severity**: Critical
**Type**: Terminology Clarity

**Description**: The specification needs clearer terminology around user types. While the feature focuses on "parent" account creation, the system supports multiple user types (parents, staff, admin, etc.). The terminology should be precise about which user type is being referenced in each context.

**Evidence**:
- spec.md: "When a parent sends a message" vs general "user authentication"
- plan.md: "Parent Account Management" vs generic "User Authentication"
- Missing clear distinction between parent accounts vs other user types in system architecture

**Impact**: Risk of implementation confusion around which user types specific features apply to, particularly in authentication and role management components.

**Recommendation**: Maintain "parent" terminology for the automatic account creation feature (as per user story) but ensure clear distinction between parent accounts and other system user types in all technical components.

#### 2. Task Requirements Misalignment
**File**: tasks.md, spec.md
**Section**: T018 Webhook Processing, T019 Authentication
**Severity**: Critical
**Type**: Implementation Gap

**Description**: Foundational tasks (T018, T019) reference non-existent technical components (AccountCreationRequest, PlatformAuthToken) that are not defined in requirements or plan.

**Evidence**:
- T018: "AccountCreationRequest model" not defined in spec.md requirements
- T019: "PlatformAuthToken" model missing from plan.md technical architecture
- Missing "webhook signature verification" requirement in spec.md

**Impact**: Implementation cannot proceed without defining these core models and requirements.

**Recommendation**: Add missing requirements to spec.md and update plan.md technical architecture to include AccountCreationRequest, PlatformAuthToken, and webhook security models.

### 🟡 Major Issues

#### 3. Missing Non-Functional Requirements
**File**: spec.md
**Section**: Requirements Section
**Severity**: Major
**Type**: Underspecification

**Description**: Complete absence of non-functional requirements for performance, scalability, and availability in the specification.

**Evidence**:
- No response time requirements for account creation
- No concurrent user handling specifications
- No availability/uptime requirements
- No data retention policies mentioned

**Impact**: System may not meet production performance expectations and operational requirements.

**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive non-functional requirements section covering performance (response time <2s), scalability (100+ concurrent users), availability (99.9% uptime), and data retention (6 months audit logs).

#### 4. Dependency Specification Missing
**File**: plan.md
**Section**: Dependencies & Integrations
**Severity**: Major
**Type**: Implementation Gap

**Description**: External service integrations (Supabase, WAHA, Telegram Bot API) lack detailed specifications and version requirements.

**Evidence**:
- No API version specifications for external services
- Missing authentication method details
- No fallback/retry strategies defined
- No rate limiting specifications for external APIs

**Impact**: Integration failures and inconsistent behavior across different service versions.

**Recommendation**: Complete the Dependencies section with specific API versions, authentication methods, retry strategies, and rate limiting requirements for all external services.

### 🟢 Minor Issues

#### 5. Ambiguous Success Criteria
**File**: spec.md
**Section**: Success Criteria
**Severity**: Minor
**Type**: Ambiguity

**Description**: Success criteria contain vague adjectives and non-measurable outcomes.

**Evidence**:
- "high success rate" - No specific target percentage
- "minimal friction" - No measurable friction metrics
- "intuitive experience" - No usability metrics

**Impact**: Difficulty in objectively validating whether implementation meets success criteria.

**Recommendation**: Replace vague terms with specific, measurable criteria (e.g., "95% account creation success rate", "completion time <30 seconds").

#### 6. Inconsistent Phone Number Format
**File**: spec.md, tasks.md
**Section**: Phone Validation Requirements
**Severity**: Minor
**Type**: Terminology Drift

**Description**: Inconsistent formatting of phone number examples across artifacts.

**Evidence**:
- spec.md: "+221 77 123 45 67"
- tasks.md: "+221761234567"
- Missing standardized format specification

**Impact**: Potential validation inconsistencies and user confusion.

**Recommendation**: Standardize phone number format to E.164 format (+221761234567) throughout all artifacts and user-facing communications.
