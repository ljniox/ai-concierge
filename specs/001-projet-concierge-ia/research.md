# Research: WhatsApp AI Concierge Service

**Branch**: `001-projet-concierge-ia` | **Date**: 2025-09-16

## Technical Research Findings

### WAHA Integration Patterns
**Decision**: Use WAHA SDK with FastAPI webhook endpoint
**Rationale**: WAHA provides official WhatsApp Business API integration with Python SDK, supports webhook pattern for real-time message handling
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct WhatsApp Business API (more complex, requires self-hosting)
- Twilio WhatsApp API (higher cost, additional abstraction layer)

### Session Management Architecture
**Decision**: Database-backed sessions with Redis caching
**Rationale**: WhatsApp conversations require state across multiple messages, Redis provides fast lookup for active sessions, PostgreSQL provides persistence
**Alternatives considered**:
- In-memory sessions only (not resilient to restarts)
- JWT tokens (insufficient for complex conversation state)

### Supabase Schema Design
**Decision**: Multi-table schema with service-specific relationships
**Rationale**: Supports multi-service routing with proper normalization, leverages Supabase's real-time capabilities
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single table approach (would become unwieldy with multiple services)
- Document store (less suitable for relational data like user-service mappings)

### Claude SDK Orchestration
**Decision**: Claude SDK with conversation management layer
**Rationale**: Provides reliable AI interaction with conversation history management, supports system prompts and context injection
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct OpenAI API (less reliable, requires more custom orchestration)
- Other LLM providers (Claude provides best balance of capability and reliability)

### Authentication & Security
**Decision**: Environment variables for secrets, JWT for internal auth
**Rationale**: Follows 12-factor app principles, JWT provides stateless authentication between services
**Alternatives considered**:
- Secrets management service (overkill for MVP)
- Basic auth (less secure for internal communications)

### Data Model Architecture
**Decision**: Entity-relationship model with clear separation of concerns
**Rationale**: Supports complex business rules while maintaining data integrity, allows for future scaling
**Alternatives considered**:
- NoSQL document store (less suitable for complex queries and relationships)
- Event sourcing (overly complex for MVP requirements)

## Integration Points

### WhatsApp Gateway (WAHA)
- **Endpoint**: `/webhook` for incoming messages
- **Outgoing**: WAHA SDK for sending responses
- **Authentication**: WAHA instance token
- **Data format**: JSON messages with media handling

### Supabase Database
- **Connection**: Supabase Python client
- **Real-time**: Enable real-time subscriptions for session updates
- **Schema**: Pre-defined tables with constraints and indexes
- **Backup**: Daily automated backups via Supabase

### Claude AI Integration
- **SDK**: Official Claude Python SDK
- **Context management**: System prompts + conversation history
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in SDK rate limiting
- **Error handling**: Retry logic with exponential backoff

## Performance Considerations

### Response Time Targets
- **Initial response**: <5 seconds from WhatsApp message receipt
- **AI processing**: <3 seconds for simple requests
- **Database queries**: <500ms for 95th percentile
- **Webhook processing**: <1 second to acknowledge receipt

### Scalability Architecture
- **Horizontal scaling**: Stateless API servers behind load balancer
- **Database**: Supabase handles scaling automatically
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed session data
- **Queue processing**: Async processing for non-critical operations

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: HTTPS for all external communications
- **Storage**: Encrypted at rest in Supabase
- **Audit logging**: All interactions logged for compliance
- **PII handling**: Minimal PII collection, anonymized analytics

### Access Control
- **Service isolation**: Each service runs with minimal required permissions
- **Admin delegation**: Role-based access control for service management
- **API security**: Request validation and rate limiting

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Strategy
- **Base image**: Python 3.11 slim
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for development, Kubernetes for production
- **Environment**: Configuration via environment variables
- **Health checks**: HTTP health endpoints for all services

### Monitoring
- **Logs**: Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- **Metrics**: Prometheus endpoints for application metrics
- **Alerting**: Error rate and performance threshold monitoring
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flows

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **WhatsApp API limits**: Monitor and handle rate limiting
- **AI reliability**: Fallback mechanisms for AI failures
- **Database performance**: Optimize queries and add appropriate indexes
- **Message delivery**: Implement retry logic for failed sends

### Operational Risks
- **Service downtime**: Graceful degradation modes
- **Data loss**: Regular backups and point-in-time recovery
- **Security breaches**: Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **GDPR compliance**: Right to be forgotten, data export capabilities
- **WhatsApp Business Policy**: Adherence to WhatsApp messaging policies
- **Local regulations**: Consider Africa/Dakar data residency requirements

### Business Continuity
- **Backup strategy**: Automated daily backups with offsite storage
- **Disaster recovery**: Multi-region deployment option
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 system health monitoring

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Set up development environment with Docker
2. Configure Supabase project and schema
3. Implement basic WAHA webhook integration
4. Create core data models and migrations

### Iterative Development
1. Implement session management
2. Add AI orchestration layer
3. Build service routing logic
4. Add admin interface components
5. Implement monitoring and logging

### Success Metrics
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime
- **Performance**: <5s initial response time
- **Error rate**: <1% failed interactions
- **Automation**: 60% simple interactions automated
