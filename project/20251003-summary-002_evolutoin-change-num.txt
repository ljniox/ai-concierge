● ✅ Evolution API Deployment Complete!

  I have successfully deployed Evolution API and configured it for WhatsApp integration. Here's the summary:

  🎯 What Was Accomplished:

  1. ✅ Deployed Evolution API
    - Container running on http://localhost:8080
    - PostgreSQL database connected
    - Authentication enabled with API key
  2. ✅ Created WhatsApp Instance
    - Instance Name: gust-ia-v2
    - Phone Number: 221773387902 (updated as requested)
    - Instance ID: 8082d33c-e5de-46dd-9365-789b07c67460
    - Status: Ready for QR code connection
  3. ✅ Updated Environment Configuration
    - Modified .env file with Evolution API settings
    - Created Evolution API service class
    - Updated instance name and token

  📱 QR Code Connection Instructions:

  The WhatsApp instance is ready for connection! To generate and scan the QR code:

  1. Access Evolution Manager:
  http://localhost:8080/manager
  2. Or use port 8082 (nginx proxy):
  http://localhost:8082/manager
  3. Steps in Manager:
    - Navigate to "Instances" section
    - Find instance gust-ia-v2
    - Click "Connect" or "Generate QR Code"
    - Scan the QR code with WhatsApp on your phone
    - Wait for connection status to change to "Connected"

  🔧 Alternative: Webhook Integration

  The system is configured to receive webhook events. Once connected via the manager interface, the Evolution API will automatically send:
  - Message events to http://localhost:8000/api/v1/webhook
  - QR code updates and connection status changes

  📋 Current Configuration:

  - API Base URL: http://localhost:8080
  - API Key: 429683C4C977415CAAFCCE10F7D57E11
  - Instance Name: gust-ia-v2
  - Instance Token: gust-ia-token-v2
  - Phone Number: 221773387902

  The Evolution API is now fully deployed and ready for WhatsApp integration! 🚀

  Next Step: Access the manager interface to generate the QR code and complete the WhatsApp connection.
