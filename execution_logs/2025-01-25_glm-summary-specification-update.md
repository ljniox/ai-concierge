**Date**: 2025-01-25T14:45:00Z
**Operation**: Specification Update Complete
**Status**: Success
**Duration**: 15 minutes

## Key Results
- âœ… Executed `/speckit.specify` workflow to address critical analysis findings
- âœ… Added 3 new functional requirements (FR-013 to FR-015)
- âœ… Added 7 comprehensive non-functional requirements (NFR-001 to NFR-007)
- âœ… Updated entity definitions with missing technical models
- âœ… Created specification quality checklist with 100% validation pass
- âœ… Updated specification status to "Critical Issues Resolved"

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. User Context Terminology Clarity âœ…
- **Issue**: Unclear distinction between parent accounts and other user types
- **Resolution**: Updated specification to clearly maintain "parent" terminology for automatic account creation while acknowledging broader system user types

### 2. Task Requirements Misalignment âœ…
- **Issue**: Missing AccountCreationRequest, PlatformAuthToken, and webhook security requirements
- **Resolution**: Added FR-013 (webhook authenticity), FR-014 (account creation processing), FR-015 (authentication tokens)

### 3. Missing Non-Functional Requirements âœ…
- **Issue**: No performance, scalability, or availability specifications
- **Resolution**: Added comprehensive NFR section with measurable targets:
  - 2-second account creation response time
  - 100+ concurrent user support
  - 99.9% uptime availability
  - 6-month audit log retention
  - Phone number privacy masking

### 4. Dependency Specification Missing âœ… (Partially)
- **Issue**: External service integration details missing
- **Resolution**: Added webhook retry and input validation requirements
- **Note**: Full API version specifications to be added in implementation plan

## Specification Quality Validation

**Checklist Results**: 100% Complete
- âœ… Content Quality: No implementation details, business-focused
- âœ… Requirement Completeness: Testable, measurable, unambiguous
- âœ… Feature Readiness: Clear acceptance criteria and success metrics

## Updated Specification Structure

**Functional Requirements**: 15 total (FR-001 to FR-015)
**Non-Functional Requirements**: 7 total (NFR-001 to NFR-007)
**Key Entities**: 7 defined (including AccountCreationRequest, PlatformAuthToken, WebhookEvent)
**User Stories**: 3 maintained with clear parent account focus

## Next Steps
1. **Ready for Planning**: Specification is now ready for `/speckit.plan` workflow
